By 2025, it is expected that $10 trillion a year could be stolen by cybercriminals. Nowadays, advanced automated security solutions are essential because they allow us to detect and respond to incidents faster, reduce security workload, etc. 

Our solution is to automate the detection of threats and defend against various cyber attacks with our system EyeSypy AI using the MITRE ATT&CK wireframes. 

MITRE ATT&CK is a collection of information about tactics and techniques that hackers use based on real-life cases. What MITRE ATT&CK does is help companies and the government build strategies to protect against attacks and create tools to defend against those attacks. MITRE ATT&CK gives details on different attacks and techniques to combat those techniques. 

Some attacks listed are Reconnaissance, Resource Development, Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, Defense Evasion, Credential Access, Discovery, Lateral Movement, Collection, Command and Control, Exfiltration, and Impact. 

Each tactic has a range from 8 to 43 techniques to combat it. 
For example, Reconnaissance is a tactic that the attacker is trying to get information they can use to plan future operations. 
Some techniques to combat reconnaissance are vulnerability scanning, scanning IP blocks, and scanning hardware and software. 

As the Blue Team, we want to evolve this agent by simulating Red Team tactics on our system and understand how they can be countered using various defensive strategies.
